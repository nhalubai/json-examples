# Python 2.x (deprecated)

**NOTICE**: Help make the world a better place and transition to python 3 already!

The Python2.x example code is located in [our git repository](https://github.com/SpotterRF/json-examples/tree/master/python2/).

Like most languages, Python comes with a JSON (de)serializer (aka parser)
as part of the standard library.

Unlike many languages, however, the JSON parser in the standard library is GOOD.

# Did you Know?

Python syntax for `dict`, `list`, `str`, and `int` literals **is** already JSON?
